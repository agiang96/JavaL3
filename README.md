Udacity Java Lesson 3: create GuessTheMovie Hangman game

Brushing up on Java by taking this course on Udacity.
Objective: 
"The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.
If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over!
BUT the more correct letters you guess the more obvious the movie becomes and at a certain point you should be able to figure it out.
The program will randomly pick a movie title from a text file that contains a large list of movies."
